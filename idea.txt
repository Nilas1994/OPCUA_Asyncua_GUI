I want to add a feature for this opcua client 

import subprocess

subprocess.call('C:\Windows\System32\powershell.exe Get-Process', shell=True)




A way where all the output is in json instead of xml also for registered nodes is want a functionality that the node is placed as a json file and can be written by external it shows the contents and current value and its structure so it can be changed externally
also if the node is not registered anymore its also not reflected in the directory and the file is gone. this as custom mode to write a node
